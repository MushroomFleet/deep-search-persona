      "Nanofluids, suspensions of nanoparticles in base fluids, significantly enhance thermal conductivity while increasing viscosity, influenced by factors like nanoparticle size, shape, concentration, and temperature; Brownian motion contributes to these effects by promoting particle diffusion and mixing.",
      "In boiling processes, phase change effects are altered by nanoparticles through mechanisms like thermophoresis and Brownian motion, which impact bubble dynamics, nucleation site density, and departure diameter, leading to improved heat transfer in subcooled boiling.",
      "Models for boiling fluids integrate Brownian motion and nanoparticle diffusion to predict properties such as viscosity and thermal conductivity; for example, molecular dynamics simulations reveal nanoscale liquid-vapor phase changes and percolation instabilities in bubble interactions during boiling crises.",
      "Bubble dynamics equations in nanofluid boiling account for surface modifications (e.g., roughness from deposited nanoparticles) and show enhanced quenching heat flux, with Eulerian multiphase models validating experimental data on two-phase flows."

    "gaps": [
      "Lack of standardized equations fully integrating all factors (viscosity, density, thermal conductivity, Brownian motion, and bubble dynamics) across different nanofluid compositions and boiling regimes.",
      "Limited real-time experimental data on deeply supercooled boiling fluids or high-concentration nanofluids, particularly regarding long-term stability and phase change latency effects.",

    "contradictions": [
      "Debate on whether thermal conductivity enhancements in nanofluids are truly 'anomalous' or simply due to classical mechanisms like Brownian motion; some studies attribute improvements to micro-convection, while others question reproducibility in boiling applications.",
      "Variability in reported effects of Brownian motion on viscosity\u2014some models predict minimal impact in high-temperature boiling, contrasting with molecular dynamics results showing significant coupling to diffusion."

    "summary": "The search results highlight the role of nanofluids in enhancing boiling fluid properties, with Brownian motion and nanoparticle diffusion playing key roles in thermal conductivity, viscosity, and phase change dynamics. Integrated models improve predictions of bubble behavior and heat transfer, though gaps in comprehensive equations and experimental validation persist, alongside debates on enhancement mechanisms."
